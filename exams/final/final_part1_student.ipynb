    "In this part, we will first start to think of how to perform an fMRI experiment. First, think of a controlled experiment that you would like to do, and how you can use two conditions to study the brain. For example, if you are interested in color representation, you could show images that are colored in one condition, and images that are black and white in the other. To find where color is represented, you can do a contrast in which you see which regions have higher activity when looking at colored images versus black and white images.\n",
