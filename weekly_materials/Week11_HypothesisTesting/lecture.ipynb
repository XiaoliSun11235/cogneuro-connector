    "In the last lab, we learned how we can use linear regression to estimate how much a voxel responds to a stimulus in an experiment.  We explained the regression problem and derived it's solution. We applied this analysis to fMRI data and estimated regression model weights for each voxel separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals\n",
    "In this lecture, we will study how to make sense of the weights that we estimate from fMRI data. The estimated regression weights of a voxel may be representative of how that voxel responds to stimuli. Alternatively, the presence of noise could have lead to weights that do not correspond to how that voxel responds to the stimuli. To distinguish between these two cases, we need to run a hypothesis test. We will learn to run one hypothesis testing procedure in this lecture.."
