    "In this homework, you will review how to load a N-D array and select an axial slice of fMRI data. Then you will use the array operations that you learned in Lecture 2 to **normalize** the dataset. **Normalization** is a mathmateical operation that removes the **scale** of your data. In other words, it transforms the minimum and maximum values of your data so they are all between 0 and 1. This is a very useful thing to do when you are dealing with data whose **scale** is meaningless, such as fMRI BOLD data. Finally, you We will make a histogram of this normalized data.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT**: We will be using a python module called OKPy to allow you to automatically submit this assignment just be running the last cell of this Juypyter Notebook. To make this work, please make sure to evaluate the cell below and follow the instructions. You can submit the notebook by evaluating the last cell."
