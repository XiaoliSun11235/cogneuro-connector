    "\n",
    "### What is fMRI?\n",
    "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, is a neuroimaging technique used to measure brain activity over time. FMRI data is acquired using an MRI machine, just as would be used for many medical purposes. MRI machines use various **pulse sequences** to take 3-Dimensional images, and different **pulse sequences** capture different types of tissue or fluids in the human (or animal) body. fMRI uses a special **pulse sequence** designed to measure changes in the magnetic properties of the blood flow of the brain. Here's a picture of a MRI machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/mri_scanner.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### The BOLD Signal\n",
    "The functional signal we measure with fMRI is *not* an electrical neural signal (as in EEG, ECoG, or electrophysiology). It is a magnetic signal related to the properties of brain tissue and fluids, and it is dominated by the differences in magnetic fields created by blood flow. Blood flow is related to neural activity, because firing neurons need oxygen. The process of neural firing involves letting electrically charged ions into a cell and actively pumping them back out again. This is a is metabolically demanding process. So once a region of the brain becomes active (once the neurons start firing), metabolism in that region is high and initiates a complex set of processes to increase blood flow to the electrically active area. When blood comes into the brain it is oxygenated, meaning it has oxygen binded to the hemoglobin molecules contained in the blood. The neurons \"take\" the oxygen from these hemoglobin molecules to use in their metabolic process, leaving the hemoglobin in a deoxygenated state. When hemoglobin is oxygenated it is magnetically neutral, but when it is deoxygenated it is magnetic. So the size of the magnetic field induced by blood is proportional to the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. The MRI machine is actually measuring this ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood across the brain. This signal is called the **\"Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent Response, or the BOLD signal\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/deoxyhemoglobin.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The vascular (blood) system of the brain responds to neural activity by flooding the region with way more oxygenated blood than is necessary, to be sure that the brain has all it needs. Thus, we are looking for an **INCREASE** in the BOLD signal (increase in ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin) as an **indirect signal** to neural activity. The specific mechanisms that lead from neural activity to changes in blood flow are (a) not well understood, and (b) beyond the scope of this class. For now, just know that there are several ways to measure functional responses with MRI, and the specific one that we work with is the BOLD response. \n",
    "\n",
    "### fMRI Images\n",
    "\n",
    "One fMRI image (fMRI volume) is acquired for a given unit of time called a r**epetition time (TR)**. A TR is typically 1-2 seconds *(usually 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 seconds)*. Every image records the activity in the brain at a given point in time. The following image shows a single volume (or TR) of fMRI data (one two-second snapshot of brain activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/fig1.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensions of the brain volume measured by fMRI can vary, but are somewhere are 20-40 **slices** tall, with each slice being ~100 x 100 pixels. Each individual fMRI measurement unit is called a **voxel**, which is short for volumetric pixel. The voxels in the data we will be using in this course are about 2.4 x 2.4 x 4.0 mm$^3$ (X x Y x Z) in size. \n",
    "\n",
    "### fMRI Activity is Time Lagged\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a neural event is triggered by a stimulus presentation the vascular system needs to respond to the need for glucose and oxygen in that specific brain area. This can take up to 1-2 seconds. Hence the hemodynamic response lags the triggered event by 1-2 seconds, which peaks around 5 seconds after the stimulus onset.\n",

    "### Pros and Cons of fMRI\n",
    "\n",
    "While fMRI is a powerful tool that has enabled a massive amount of new research questions to be answered, but it is by far a perfect technology. It is a complex technology, and all this complexity should always be a source of humility for anyone working with fMRI or trying to interpret fMRI results. Here we will outline a few of the largest **pros** and **cons** of this neuroimaging technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "Let's start with the bad.\n",
    "- It is an **indirect, slow measure** with poor **temporal resolution** - and these considerations strongly constrain the kinds of experiments you can do with fMRI and the conclusions you can draw from those experiments. For example, you can't say much about the timing of neural events, as 2 seconds is an eternity when it comes to the firing patterns of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/imaging_modalities.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "                                      Sejnowski et al., Nature Neurosci., 2014\n",
    "- It is still very expensive, which means that many studies are grossly underpowered. This can lead to many issues, such as the reproducibility crises we're seeing in Psychology.\n",
    "- Whatever experiment you want to do, it has to be done in a big, constraining, loud MRI scanner. This limits the types of experiments that can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "It's not all bad news though, there is a reason so many people use fMRI to do cognitive neuroscience reasearch:\n",
    "- It is non-invasive! Meaning, we don't have to cut open people's skulls to measure their brain activity. Just think about that for a minute. We can actually put people into this machine and see what their brain is doing! It is seriously magical.\n",
    "- It has much better spatial resolution than previous non-invasive neuroimaging modalities (e.g EEG or MEG). Though it is still fairly crude. Each value we get from the MRI scanner is the aggregated signal of up to 100,000 neurons! So this is a *relative Pro*!\n",
    "- There are many different things the MRI scanner can measure when it comes to brain activity. The BOLD signal we mentioned is an indirect measure of neural activity, but MRI scanners can also be used to:\n",
    "    - Measure the **white matter** tracts (i.e. the \"wires\" of the brain) using **Diffusor Tensor Imaging (DTI)**\n",
    "    - Measure metabolic activity using **MR spectroscopy**, aka **Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI)**.\n",
    "    - Measure when groups of neurons fire similarly, allowing for the mapping of brain **networks**. This is called **functional connectivity**.\n",
    "    - Measure changes in brain tissue mass, called **MR morphology**"

All of the values in an array are of the same type, however. They are **sequences**, meaning they store the values they contain in a specific order. Arrays can be 1-dimensional (1-D), 2-dimesional (2-D) and 3-dimensional (3-D). In fact, they can have any number of dimensions you like, which is usually called N-dimensional. \n",

While this is a very useful function, working with fMRI data requires the use of 2-D, 3-D and even 4-D arrays, so we will need to learn another way to create arrays. For this we will use the `numpy` module, which we have to `import`. You've learned a little about this module when you saw some of the **functions** that work on arrays, like `np.sum`"

The reasons why this convention is more convenient (like easier syntax and shortcuts while averaging over time and transfering data to a standard units, for example) will become more obvious as we go.

    "As we've seen the data we have loaded is 4-D data, with 120 volumes, 30 entries on the Z-axis, 100 on the Y-axis, and 100 on the X-axis. What if we want to look at the data of just the 35th volume, in just the 10th Z-axis value? To do this we use **Array Slicing** (sometimes called **indexing**). We will give a quick example here, because you'll need to do a little bit of this for your homework. We'll go into greater detail in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array slicing** is done using a combination of the `[]` operators (pronounced **square-brackets**) and numbers or the `:` operator (pronounced **colon**). To get a slice from an N-D array, you add the **square-brackets** after the **name**. You then indicate which values you want from the data, either using number(s) or the `:` to indicate that you want all of the values. Here is an example: "

    "\n",
    "Eventually we'll want to do some pretty cool statistical analyses and tests, and then visualize the findings from those analyses, but we need to learn to crawl before we can run. In general, the first thing you want to do with any data set you'll be working with (in neuroscience, or any other field) is to \"look\" at it. Sometimes this literally means looking at the raw numbers in an excel spreadsheet, but that is only for the simplest of cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have large datasets, such as with fMRI brain data, you need to find ways of exploring that data that are manageable to comprehend. Today we'll look at two ways of doing so, by generating **Descriptive Statistics** and **Histograms** of our data, in order to get a feeling for what it \"looks\" like."

The first thing you might want to do is to measure the height of a number of specimens that you find (say 100 of them). If you wanted to convey to someone back home the size of these creatures, you might think to describe several things about their heights:\n",
