    "# Overview\n",
    "In the last lab and in the homework, we saw how we can model the response of a voxel $v$ to a stimulus $i$ via the hemodynamic response function, and a weight $\\beta^v_i$. To do this we assume that we know the shape of the hemodynamic response, and we assume a value for how well a voxel responds to a stimulus. But in reality, we do not know these. The hemodynamic response has been a subject for a lot of research and therefore it is common to use a canonical function like the one we explored last week. However, estimating how much a voxel responds to a specific stimulus is exactly what the purpose of an fMRI experiment is.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals\n",
    "Here, we will go over how we can use linear regression to estimate how much a voxel responds to each stimulus in an experiment. We will first explain the regression problem and derive it's solution. We will then apply this analysis to real data."
