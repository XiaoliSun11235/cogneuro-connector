    "# Overview\n",
    "In the last lab, we went over how we can use linear regression to estimate how much a voxel responds to each stimulus in an experiment, and how to use hypothesis testing to determine if a specific condition activates a voxel more than another condition. We saw how to estimate a t-statistic, compute a p-value and use multiple comparison correction. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals\n",
    "The regression models we build are predictive models. We can use them to predict the activity for each conditions. We will see in this lab how we can perform this prediction. We will also see how we can use complex stimulus that is not neatly categorized into conditions. Learning the brain responses to the different properties of the stimulus will allow us to build models that can predict the activity for new, unseen conditions."

What if we could learn the responses to specific properties of words (e.g. whether or not they are animate, whether or not they are edible etc...). Then we predict the activity of a novel word as a combination of the activities associated with its properties. For example, we can learn how the brain responds to objects that are manmade, inanimate, made of wood and that are used as tools, and we can estimate the brain response of \"pen\" as the combination of these responses.\n",

    "Imagine you have a small dataset with voxel responses to features, and some of the voxels have some noise that is correlated to one of the features. The probability of such an event becomes smaller as the dataset size increases, but at low sample sizes there is a good chance of finding spurious correlations. Such a correlation actually allows you to build a model that predicts brain activity from the features, but only in that dataset, since the noise is independent of the data and will not repeat in the same way in other datasets. However, for the voxels that show a real and strong enough response to the features, you will be able to learn a model that predicts brain activity from the features, and that model should generalize to new data.\n",
