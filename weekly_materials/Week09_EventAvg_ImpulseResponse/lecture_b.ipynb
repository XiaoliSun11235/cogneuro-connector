    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lab, we computed event-related averages for responses to different categories of objects. We saw that response in fMRI emerge slowly (2-3 TRs or 4-6 seconds) after the onset of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the most common thing that we want to know in fMRI experiments is how some event is related to brain responses. The event related averages show us that some areas of the brain respond more to some stimuli than others, but we would like a more firm statistical basis before we draw any conclusions from our data. This week, we will introduce how to model the delay in that data.\n",

    "fMRI responses emerge slowly after the onset of a stimulus (or any other event). This means that, if we want to make an accurate mathematical model of how the brain responds, we have to somehow incorporate this delay into our model. \n",

    "To do this, we will borrow a concept from signal processing theory called the impulse response function. An impulse response function describes the way a signal emerges (for any system) after an event. The way the BOLD response emerges after an experimental event is called the *hemodynamic response function* or HRF. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of early fMRI research went into accurately describing how the BOLD signal rises, falls, and resets to baseline after an event. We will rely on the conclusions of this research without going into much detail about it. For an overview of hemodynamic responses in fMRI, check out [this blog post](http://mindhive.mit.edu/node/72), and the papers in the `figures/` directory for week 8 (Handwerker, Bandettini et al 2012; Logothetis & Wandell, 2004). The practical upshot of this work is that BOLD responses have a fairly characteristic shape, which is well described by a mathematical function called a *gamma function*. \n",
